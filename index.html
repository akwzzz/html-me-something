            <p><h2>Metallica</h2>
            I was lucky enough to win Snakepit Passes for the 2017 Metallica show at Busch Stadium.
            I took my friend Mike, a lifelong Metallica fan, to the show with me. We watched the show from a pit built 
            inside of the stage, and were close enough that we could touch and high-five all the members
            of the band! The entire experience was surreal,
            and we had the time of our lives!</p><br>

            <p><h2>Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers</h2>
                I've been a massive Tom Petty fan for many years, and when he announced what would sadly become his final tour,
                I immediately knew that I had to see him again. I had been saving a Ticketmaster gift card for just the 
                right occasion, and was able to score a lone seat in the 3rd row. Although I attended the show by myself, it was
                one of the most magical nights of my life. Through his music, radio show, and other projects, Tom has been a
                constant influence through many phases of my life, and I will always be grateful for this last opportunity
                to see him perform. </p><br>

                <p><h2>Ray Wylie Hubbard & Billy Joe Shaver</h2>
                    Both of these artists are true legends in the outlaw country music scene. Each's songwriting genius
                    rivals that of the other, and they both possess a unique, powerful, and at times humorous, style of
                    storytelling. I've had the honor of meeting them both, and getting a few autographs has been the 
                    icing on the cake.</p><br>
